        To your Talent Acquisition team:<br><br>

        I am applying to the position of Web Designer/Front End Developer. I am confident my background and my skill
        sets in information technology and digital media will ensure successful relations and outcomes. My current CCENT
        (Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician) certification makes me extremely valuable to providing networking
        services and troubleshooting, which could help ensure web delivery.<br><br>

        I studied Video Production at the University of Denver and graduated with my 4-year bachelorâ€™s degree in only 3
        years. Immediately after graduating, I began working for Denver Public Schools. In this capacity I taught
        students who had no previous experience with desktop computers how to use complex tools and methods in software
        programs. This also involved communicated highly technical concepts to students that had little to no technical
        knowledge which translates directly to help desk support and working with clients with little to no technical
        experience or knowledge. One has to be able to manage and keep a classroom of 35 individuals motivated to learn,
        while designing an engaging curriculum that is technologically up to date. Teaching also requires building
        strong relationships with students and is closely related to customer success and service in this regard. It
        also has allowed me to build invaluable interpersonal communication skills, verbally and in writing.<br><br>

        In my role as a digital media teacher I maintained large computer labs, including Mac and Windows PCs, Laptops,
        and professional AV equipment, not limited to cameras, smart boards, and audio equipment. I am highly skilled in
        replacing hard drives, RAM, keyboards and batteries in laptops and desktops, as well as installing and
        maintaining complex software, reimaging hard drives, and using virtual workstations. I was the CEO of a startup
        a
        web design business until I was injured, The Brink Media LLC, which has facilitated me learning IT systems and
        web design in greater depth. In my
        capacity as CEO I managed their current design and sales teams, and created financial reports and projections. I
        take
        pride in learning new skills and technologies and am always working to continue learning and growing no matter
        how busy my schedule is. I am extremely driven individual with high ambition. My personal goal right now is to
        develop a strong career in web design.<br><br>

        I excel in challenging environments. I am used to working long hours outside of work in order to do the best job
        I can and to deliver results. I know my experience, diligence, and my eagerness to learn and grow will make me a
        great fit for the roles to be assumed in the position of Web Designer/Front End Developer. Thank you for
        reviewing my application. I look forward to meeting your staff.<br><br>

        Sincerely,<br>
        Matthew Brignola
